 # The example code in chap05.ipynb shows how to use autocorrelation to estimate the
 #  fundamental frequency of a periodic signal. Encapsulate this code in a function
 #  called estimate_fundamental, and use it to track the pitch of a recorded sound.
 # To see how well it works, try superimposing your pitch estimates on a spectrogram
 #  of the recording.
