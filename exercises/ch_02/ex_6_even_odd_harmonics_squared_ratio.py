 # Triangle and square waves have odd harmonics only; the sawtooth wave has both even and
# odd harmonics. The harmonics of the square and sawtooth waves drop off in proportion to 1/f
# the harmonics of the triangle wave drop off like 1/f^2.
# Can you find a waveform that has even and odd harmonics that drop off like 1/f^2?
