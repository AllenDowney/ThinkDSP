    "\n",
    "A **signal** represents a quantity that varies in time. That definition\n",
    "is pretty abstract, so let's start with a concrete example: sound. Sound\n",
    "is variation in air pressure. A sound signal represents variations in\n",
    "air pressure over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "A microphone is a device that measures these variations and generates an\n",
    "electrical signal that represents sound. A speaker is a device that\n",
    "takes an electrical signal and produces sound. Microphones and speakers\n",
    "are called **transducers** because they transduce, or convert, signals\n",
    "from one form to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "This book is about signal processing, which includes processes for\n",
    "synthesizing, transforming, and analyzing signals. I will focus on sound\n",
    "signals, but the same methods apply to electronic signals, mechanical\n",
    "vibration, and signals in many other domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "They also apply to signals that vary in space rather than time, like\n",
    "elevation along a hiking trail. And they apply to signals in more than\n",
    "one dimension, like an image, which you can think of as a signal that\n",
    "varies in two-dimensional space. Or a movie, which is a signal that\n",
    "varies in two-dimensional space *and* time.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we start with simple one-dimensional sound.\n",

    "We'll start with **periodic signals**, which are signals that repeat\n",

    "three full repetitions, also known as **cycles**. The duration of each\n",
    "cycle, called the **period**, is about 2.3 ms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **frequency** of a signal is the number of cycles per second, which\n",

    "of cycles is a dimensionless number, so a Hertz is really a \"per\n",
    "second\").\n",
    "\n",
    "The frequency of this signal is about 439 Hz, slightly lower than 440\n",
    "Hz, which is the standard tuning pitch for orchestral music. The musical\n",
    "name of this note is A, or more specifically, A4. If you are not\n",
