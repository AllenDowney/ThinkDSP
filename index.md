_Think DSP: Digital Signal Processing in Python_ is an introduction to digital signal processing
using Python.  The premise of this book (and the other books in the _Think X_ series) is that if 
you know how to program, you can use that skill to learn other things.  

I wrote this book because I think the conventional
approach to digital signal processing is backward: most books (and the classes that use them) present
the material bottom-up, starting with mathematical abstractions like phasors.

With a programming-based approach, I can go top-down, which means I can present the most important
ideas right away.  By the end of the first chapter, you can
break down a sound into its harmonics, modify the harmonics, and generate new sounds.

### Freesound

Special thanks to Freesound (http://freesound.org), which is the source of many of the
sound samples I use in this book, and to the Freesound users who
uploaded those sounds.  I include some of their wave files in
the GitHub repository for this book, using the original file
names, so it should be easy to find their sources.

Unfortunately, most Freesound users don't make their real names
available, so I can only thank them by user name.  Samples
used in this book were contributed by Freesound users: iluppai,
wcfl10, thirsk, docquesting, kleeb, landup, zippi1, themusicalnomad,
bcjordan, rockwehrmann, marchascon7, jcveliz.  Thank you all!
